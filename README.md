<h1>So What is gLRuManager?</h1>

It is a HTTP REST based geo distributed with near realtime cross origin data replication, LRU caching service. It also supports low latency response times based on closest edge location. There is also an automatic fail over call back function in case one of the nodes fails to send a json response for a client request

There is one central node to which client send api requests with the choice for the cache to be checked. There maybe several secondary nodes. The central node also sends the secondary nodes a JSON object containing a list of all active nodes. Node 0 is the central node by default. 

Features:

- Configarible cache size
- Autofail over to next closest node
- Caching and deletion based on least used item
- Automatic data replicationa across all nodes
- Low latency geolocation based responses from edge lcoations

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

Node.js Express Axios !

<h1> How does it work?</h1>

1. Client sends a POST reqquest with location and choice to central server
2. Central server finds closest node by comparing location
3. Central server posts info "" to cleint
4 If this request to post fails, it triggers the next closest location to send the same
5. Cache is checked and updated if need be everytime a client posts a choice to the central server
6. Whenever, cache is updated in any particular node, a post request is send to all nodes witht he latest cache file for global replication


<h1>Configuring the setup</h1>

- git clone repo onto central node server
- npm install
- To configure, set node index to 0 in index.js
